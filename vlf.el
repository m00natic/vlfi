;;; Commentary:
;; This package provides the M-x vlf command, which visits part of
;; large file without loading it entirely.  The buffer uses VLF mode,
;; which provides several commands for moving around, searching,
;; comparing and editing selected part of file.
;; To have it offered when opening large files:
;; (require 'vlf-setup)

;; This package was inspired by a snippet posted by Kevin Rodgers,
;; showing how to use `insert-file-contents' to extract part of a
;; file.
